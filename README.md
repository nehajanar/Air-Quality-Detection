# AI4ALL Final Project: AQI Prediction Using LSTM Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using time-series analysis and deep learning methodologies. Leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, we trained a model to forecast daily AQI based on historical data, various pollutants, and meteorological factors. This project showcases advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and neural network modeling within the context of predictive analytics.

**Skills Applied**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, time-series analysis, deep learning (LSTM), hyperparameter tuning, and visualization.

**Program Context**: Conducted as part of AI4ALL, this project illustrates the application of AI techniques in environmental data science.

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

With the increasing need to monitor and improve air quality for public health, accurate AQI forecasting has become essential. Predicting AQI can help individuals and governments take preventive measures against poor air quality days, potentially reducing health risks and economic impacts.

**Relevance**: This project addresses the critical issue of air pollution by providing a tool for anticipatory action. It can support policymakers, public health organizations, and the general public in making informed decisions to mitigate pollution effects.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
